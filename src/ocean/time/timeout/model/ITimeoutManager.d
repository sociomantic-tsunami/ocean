/*******************************************************************************

    Timeout manager interface

    The reason for this interface is to avoid requiring an application to be
    linked against the libebtree, which is required by TimeoutManager and
    ExpiryRegistration, when it uses a library module that supports a timeout
    functionality as an optional feature.
    Therefore, library modules that support a timeout functionality as an
    optional feature should always use this interface and not import
    TimeoutManager/ExpiryRegistration.

        Checks for timed out clients. For any timed out client its timeout()

        This method should be called when the timeout set by setTimeout() has
        expired.

        If dg returns false to cancel, the clients iterated over so far are
        removed. To remove the remaining clients, call this method again.

                 out client and must return true to continue or false to cancel.

        Note: Depending on the implementation, this method may return a newly
              created object that should be kept and reused by the application.
              It is also application dependent whether the client remains
              associated to the expiry registration object after it has been
              unregistered from the timeout manager or not.
