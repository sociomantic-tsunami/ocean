/*******************************************************************************

    A D wrapper around the GNU readline/history file

    The module contains functionalities to manipulate the readline session
    history (e.g adding lines to the history so when the user would press the
    up-arrow he would find the old lines).

    Notes:
        - Requires linking with -lhistory
        - The user of this module doesn't need to call `using_history()` as its
          automatically called once this module is imported.

    Add a line to the history of the readline

    Note:
        If line isn't null-terminated then it's converted to a C null-terminated
        string before passing it to the C add_history function.
        Converting to C string might re-allocate the buffer. If you have tight
        memory constraints, it is highly recommended to provide a null
        terminated string or make sure that the GC block your buffer is stored
        in has a spare byte at the end.

    Params:
        line = the line to add to history
