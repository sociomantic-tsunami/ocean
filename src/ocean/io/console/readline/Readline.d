    A D wrapper around the GNU readline/readline file

    readline is a powerful library for reading the user input from the console.

    For example if an application frequently asks for user-input during its
    operation then using readline provides the following benefits:
       - User can browse previous submitted lines using up/down arrows.
       - Terminal shortcuts (e.g ctrl+r, ctrl+w, ctrl+y) are enabled by default.
       - Providing text auto-completion, by default it is enabled to complete
         files and directories for the path that the application was run from.
       - Make the application use the customized configuration that the user
         defined for readline on his machine.

    There are much more functionalities that the readline library provides.
    Please refer to the documentation for the more information:

/*******************************************************************************

    Reads a line from the terminal and return it, using prompt as a prompt.
    If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no prompt is issued.
    The line returned has the final newline removed, so only the text of the
    line remains.

    Except for the note below, the documentation is taken from the manpage of
    readline. Refer to the readline manpage for more extensive documentation.

    Note:
        If prompt isn't null-terminated and isn't null then it's converted to a
        C null-terminated string before passing it to the C readline function.
        Converting to C string might re-allocate the buffer. If you have tight
        memory constraints, it is highly recommended to provide a null
        terminated string or make sure that the GC block your buffer is stored
        in has a spare byte at the end.

    Params:
        prompt = the string to be prompted to the user (see note above)
        buffer = optional buffer to store the user input, if the buffer is null
        then it would be allocated only if the user provided an input.

    Returns:
        Returns the text of the line read. A blank line returns empty string.
        If EOF is encountered while reading a line, and the line is empty, null
        is returned.  If an EOF  is  read  with  a non-empty line, it is treated
        as a newline.
