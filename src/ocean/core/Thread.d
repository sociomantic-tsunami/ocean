/**
 * The thread module provides support for thread creation and management.
 *
 * If AtomicSuspendCount is used for speed reasons all signals are sent together.
 * When debugging gdb funnels all signals through one single handler, and if
 * the signals arrive quickly enough they will be coalesced in a single signal,
 * (discarding the second) thus it is possible to loose signals, which blocks
 * the program. Thus when debugging it is better to use the slower SuspendOneAtTime
 * version.
