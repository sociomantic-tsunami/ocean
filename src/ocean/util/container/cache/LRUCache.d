/*******************************************************************************

    (L)east (R)ecently (U)sed Cache class, Caches data items according to their
    access time and discards item that were least recently accessed.

    Cache of raw data (ubyte[] / void[]) items of either fixed or variable
    length. The cache is initialised with a fixed capacity (the number of items
    that can be stored). When the cache reaches its full capacity, any newly
    added items will replace older items in the cache. The cache keeps track of
    the last time each item was written or read, and will replace the oldest
    items first.

    The basic Cache template is used to store raw data. A second template exists
    which takes a type as its parameter. This implements a thin wrapper around
    the basic Cache, allowing the transparent storage of (no-op) serialized
    values of the specified type.


    Note that with variable value length anything stored in the cache is
    invisible to the garbage collector because the internal value data type of
    the cache is ubyte[]. So if you store references (objects, pointers, slices
    to dynamic arrays) in the cache with variable value length, make sure your
    application keeps a reference to it. Otherwise the object referenced to may
    be garbage collected and attempting to use it after getting it from the
    cache will make your program go to HELL.

    When a cache element is removed explicitly (by calling remove()), the value
    of the removed element is kept in the cache in a spare location. If required
    it is possible to erase the value by overriding Cache.replaceRemovedItem(),
    see the description of this method for an example.

    When a cache element is removed automatically if the cache is full and a new
    element is added, Cache.whenCacheItemDropped(size_t index) will be called. If
    required it is possible to be notified of this occurrence by overriding
    Cache.whenCacheItemDropped method.

    Cache.getOrCreate() return a reference to a record in the cache.
    Cache.getAndRefresh() return a reference to a record in the cache or
    returns null otherwise.
    For fixed length values the record value reference is a slice to the record
    value.
    Usage example:

    ---

        import ocean.util.container.LRUCache;

        // Create a fixed-size cache which can store 2 items, each of length 3.
        auto cache = new LRUCache!(char[3])(2);

        // Add an item using getOrCreate(). getOrCreate() returns a pointer to
        // void[] array with length 3 which references the value in the cache.

        hash_t key = 0x12345678;

        char[3] val = "abc";

        *cache.getOrCreate(key) = val[];

        // Obtain an item using getAndRefresh(). If found, getAndRefresh()
        // returns a pointer to a value slice just like getOrCreate() or null
        // if not found.

        char[] val_got = cache.getAndRefresh(key);

        if (val_got !is null)
        {
            // val_got contains the value that corresponds to key.
            // The value in the cache can be modified in-place by setting array
            // elements or copying to the whole array:

            (cast(char[])val_got)[2] = '!'; // Set the third value byte to '!'.

            (cast(char[])val_got)[] = "def"; // Set the value to "def".
        }
        else
        {
            // not found
        }

    ---

    For variable length arrays it is a pointer to the Cache.Value struct which
    encapsulates the value, which is void[], providing access to the value via
    operator overloading:

        - opAssign sets the value array instance to an input array slice
          (overwriting the previous array instance),
        - opSliceAssign treats the value array as an allocated buffer and copies
          the content of the an input array slice into the value array,
        - opSlice returns the value array.

    opSliceAssign reuses an existing buffer and is therefore memory-friendly as
    long as opAssign is not used with the same value instance.

    Rule of thumb: For each cache instance with variable value size use either
    opAssign or opSliceAssign with the values, never both.

    Usage Example 1: Store string slices in a cache using Value.opAssign.

    ---

        auto cache = new LRUCache!(char[])(100);

        char[] str1 = "Hello World",
               str2 = "Eggs and Spam";

        {
            auto val = cache.getRefreshOrCreate(4711);

            // Store a slice to str1 in the array using (*val).opAssign.

            *val = str1;
        }

        {
            auto val = cache.getAndRefresh(4711);

            // (*val)[] ((*val).opSlice) now returns a slice to str1.

            // Replace this value with a slice to str2 using (*val).opAssign.

            *val = str2;
        }

    ---

    Usage Example 2: Store copies of strings in a cache using
                     Value.opSliceAssign.

    ---

        auto cache = new LRUCache!(char[])(100);

        char[] str1 = "Hello World",
               str2 = "Eggs and Spam";

        {
            auto val = cache.getRefreshOrCreate(4711);

            // Allocate a value array buffer with str1.length and copy the
            // content of str1 into that value buffer.

            (*val)[] = str1;
        }

        {
            auto val = cache.getAndRefresh(4711);

            // (*val)[] ((*val).opSlice) now returns the value array buffer
            // which contains a copy of the content of str1.

            // Use (*val)[] = str2 ((*val).opSliceAssign(x)) to resize the value
            // array buffer to str2.length and copy the content of str2 into it.

            (*val)[] = str2;
        }

    ---

    For special situations it is possible to obtain a pointer to the value
    array. One such situation is when the value array needs to be modified by
    an external function which doesn't know about the cache.

    ---

        void setValue ( ref void[] value )
        {
            value = "Hello World!";
        }

        auto cache = new LRUCache!(char[])(100);

        auto val = cache.getRefreshOrCreate(4711);

        void[]* val_array = cast (void[]*) (*val);

        setValue(*val_array);
