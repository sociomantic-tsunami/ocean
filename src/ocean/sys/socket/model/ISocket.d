                The domain argument specifies a communication domain; this sel-

            type = desired socket type, which specifies the communication
                semantics.  Supported types are

                SOCK_STREAM     Provides sequenced, reliable,  two-way,  connec‐
                                tion-based  byte  streams.   An out-of-band data
                                transmission mechanism may be supported.

                SOCK_DGRAM      Supports datagrams - connectionless,  unreliable
                                messages of a fixed maximum length.

                SOCK_SEQPACKET  Provides  a sequenced, reliable, two-way connec‐
                                tion-based data transmission path for  datagrams
                                of  fixed maximum length; a consumer is required
                                to read an entire packet with each input  system
                                call.

                SOCK_RAW        Provides raw network protocol access.

                Some  socket  types may not be implemented by all protocol fami‐
                lies;  for  example,  SOCK_SEQPACKET  is  not  implemented   for
                AF_INET (IPv4).

                Since  Linux  2.6.27, the type argument serves a second purpose:
                in addition to specifying a socket type, it may include the bit‐
                wise  OR  of any of the following values, to modify the behavior
                of socket():

                SOCK_NONBLOCK   Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on  the  new
                                open  file  description.   Using this flag saves
                                extra calls to  fcntl(2)  to  achieve  the  same
                                result.

                SOCK_CLOEXEC    Set  the  close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the
                                new file descriptor.  See the description of the
                                O_CLOEXEC  flag  in open(2) for reasons why this
                                may be useful.

            protocol = desired protocol or 0 to use the default protocol for the
                specified type (e.g. TCP for `type == SOCK_STREAM` or UDP for
                `type == SOCK_DGRAM`).

                The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
                socket.   Normally  only  a  single protocol exists to support a
                particular socket type within a given protocol family, in  which
                case  protocol  can  be specified as 0.  However, it is possible
                that many protocols may exist, in which case a particular proto‐
                col  must  be  specified in this manner.  The protocol number to
                use is specific to the “communication domain” in which  communi‐
                cation  is  to take place; see protocols(5).  See getprotoent(3)
                on how to map protocol name strings to protocol numbers.

                Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams,  simi‐
                lar to pipes.  They do not preserve record boundaries.  A stream
                socket must be in a connected state before any data may be  sent
                or  received  on  it.  A connection to another socket is created
                with a connect(2) call.  Once connected, data may be transferred
                using  read(2) and write(2) calls or some variant of the send(2)
                and recv(2) calls.  When a session has been completed a close(2)
                may  be  performed.  Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as
                described in send(2) and received as described in recv(2).

            the socket file descriptor on success or -1 on failure. On failure
            errno is set appropriately and this.fd is -1.

        Accepts a connection from a listening socket and sets this.fd to the
        accepted socket file descriptor.

        Note: This generic wrapper should be used only in special situations,
        the subclass variants for a particular address family are preferred.

        The  accept()  system  call  is  used with connection-based socket types
        (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).  It extracts the first connection request
        on  the  queue  of pending connections for the listening socket, creates
        a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor  referring  to
        that socket.  The newly  created socket  is not in the listening  state.
        The original socket is unaffected by this call.

        If  no  pending  connections are present on the queue, and the socket is
        not marked as nonblocking, accept() blocks the caller until a connection
        is  present.  If the socket is marked nonblocking and no pending connec‐
        tions are present on the queue, accept() fails with the error EAGAIN  or
        EWOULDBLOCK.

        In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket, you can use
        select(2) or poll(2).  A readable event will be  delivered  when  a  new
        connection  is  attempted and you may then call accept() to get a socket
        for that connection.  Alternatively, you can set the socket  to  deliver
        SIGIO when activity occurs on a socket; see socket(7) for details.

    /**************************************************************************

        Connects this socket the specified address and port.

        Note: This generic wrapper should be used only in special situations,
        the subclass variants for a particular address family are preferred.

        If  this socket is of type SOCK_DGRAM  then the  address  is the one  to
        which datagrams are sent by default, and the  only  address  from  which
        datagrams  are  received.   If  the  socket  is  of  type SOCK_STREAM or
        SOCK_SEQPACKET, this call attempts to make a connection  to  the  socket
        that is bound to the address specified by addr.

        Generally,  connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect()
        only once; connectionless protocol sockets may  use  connect()  multiple
        times  to change their association.  Connectionless sockets may dissolve
        the association by connecting to an address with the sa_family member of
        sockaddr set to AF_UNSPEC (supported on Linux since kernel 2.2).

        Params:
            remote_address = remote internet address, expected to point to a sin_addr
                      or sin6_addr instance, depending on the IP version of this
                      instance

        Returns:
            0 on success or -1 on failure. On error failure is set
            appropriately.

        Errors:
            The  following  are  general socket errors only.  There may be other
            domain-specific error codes.

            EACCES For Unix domain sockets, which are  identified  by  pathname:
                   Write permission is denied on the socket file, or search per‐
                   mission is denied for one of the directories in the path pre‐
                   fix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

            EACCES, EPERM
                   The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without hav‐
                   ing the socket  broadcast  flag  enabled  or  the  connection
                   request failed because of a local firewall rule.

            EADDRINUSE
                   Local address is already in use.

            EAFNOSUPPORT
                  The passed address didn't have the correct address family in
                  its sa_family field.

            EAGAIN No more free local ports or insufficient entries in the rout‐
                   ing    cache.    For   AF_INET   see   the   description   of
                   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range ip(7) for  information
                   on how to increase the number of local ports.

            EALREADY
                   The  socket  is nonblocking and a previous connection attempt
                   has not yet been completed.

            EBADF  The file descriptor is not a valid index  in  the  descriptor
                   table.

            ECONNREFUSED
                   No-one listening on the remote address.

            EFAULT The  socket  structure  address is outside the user's address
                   space.

            EINPROGRESS
                   The socket is nonblocking and the connection cannot  be  com‐
                   pleted  immediately.   It is possible to select(2) or poll(2)
                   for completion by selecting the socket  for  writing.   After
                   select(2)  indicates  writability,  use getsockopt(2) to read
                   the SO_ERROR option at level SOL_SOCKET to determine  whether
                   connect() completed successfully (SO_ERROR is zero) or unsuc‐
                   cessfully (SO_ERROR is one of the usual  error  codes  listed
                   here, explaining the reason for the failure).

            EINTR  The  system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught;
                   see signal(7).

            EISCONN
                   The socket is already connected.

            ENETUNREACH
                   Network is unreachable.

            ENOTSOCK
                   The file descriptor is not associated with a socket.

            ETIMEDOUT
                   Timeout while attempting connection.  The server may  be  too
                   busy to accept new connections.  Note that for IP sockets the
                   timeout may be very long when syncookies are enabled  on  the
                   server.

                MSG_CONFIRM (Since Linux 2.3.15)
                       Tell  the  link layer that forward progress happened: you
                       got a successful reply from the other side.  If the  link
                       layer  doesn't  get  this  it  will regularly reprobe the
                       neighbor (e.g.,  via  a  unicast  ARP).   Only  valid  on
                       SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets and currently only imple‐
                       mented for IPv4 and IPv6.  See arp(7) for details.

                MSG_DONTROUTE
                       Don't use a gateway to send out the packet, only send  to
                       hosts  on  directly  connected networks.  This is usually
                       used only by diagnostic or  routing  programs.   This  is
                       only  defined  for  protocol  families that route; packet
                       sockets don't.

                MSG_DONTWAIT (since Linux 2.2)
                       Enables nonblocking operation;  if  the  operation  would
                       block,  EAGAIN  or EWOULDBLOCK is returned (this can also
                       be enabled using the O_NONBLOCK  flag  with  the  F_SETFL
                       fcntl(2)).

                MSG_EOR (since Linux 2.2)
                       Terminates  a  record  (when this notion is supported, as
                       for sockets of type SOCK_SEQPACKET).

                MSG_MORE (Since Linux 2.4.4)
                       The caller has more data to send.  This flag is used with
                       TCP  sockets  to  obtain  the same effect as the TCP_CORK
                       socket option (see tcp(7)), with the difference that this
                       flag can be set on a per-call basis.

                       Since  Linux  2.6,  this  flag  is also supported for UDP
                       sockets, and informs the kernel to  package  all  of  the
                       data sent in calls with this flag set into a single data‐
                       gram which is only transmitted when a call  is  performed
                       that  does not specify this flag.  (See also the UDP_CORK
                       socket option described in udp(7).)

                MSG_NOSIGNAL (since Linux 2.2)
                       Requests not to send SIGPIPE on errors on stream oriented
                       sockets  when  the  other end breaks the connection.  The
                       EPIPE error is still returned.

                MSG_OOB
                       Sends out-of-band  data  on  sockets  that  support  this
                       notion (e.g., of type SOCK_STREAM); the underlying proto‐
                       col must also support out-of-band data.

        Returns:
            the number of src bytes sent on success or -1 on failure.
            On failure errno is set appropriately.

        Errors:
            These are some standard errors generated by the socket layer.  Addi‐
            tional errors may be generated and returned from the underlying pro‐
            tocol modules; see their respective manual pages.

            EACCES (For Unix domain sockets, which are identified  by  pathname)
                   Write permission is denied on the destination socket file, or
                   search permission is denied for one of  the  directories  the
                   path prefix.  (See path_resolution(7).)

            EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
                   The  socket is marked nonblocking and the requested operation
                   would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned
                   for  this  case, and does not require these constants to have
                   the same value, so a portable application  should  check  for
                   both possibilities.

            EBADF  An invalid descriptor was specified.

            ECONNRESET
                   Connection reset by peer.

            EDESTADDRREQ
                   The  socket  is  not  connection-mode, and no peer address is
                   set.

            EFAULT An invalid user space address was specified for an argument.

            EINTR  A signal occurred before any data was transmitted;  see  sig‐
                   nal(7).

            EINVAL Invalid argument passed.

            EISCONN
                   The connection-mode socket was connected already but a recip‐
                   ient was specified.  (Now either this error is  returned,  or
                   the recipient specification is ignored.)

            EMSGSIZE
                   The socket type requires that message be sent atomically, and
                   the size of the message to be sent made this impossible.

            ENOBUFS
                   The output queue for a network interface was full.  This gen‐
                   erally  indicates that the interface has stopped sending, but
                   may be caused by transient congestion.  (Normally, this  does
                   not occur in Linux.  Packets are just silently dropped when a
                   device queue overflows.)

            ENOMEM No memory available.

            ENOTCONN
                   The socket is not connected, and no target has been given.

            ENOTSOCK
                   The argument sockfd is not a socket.

            EOPNOTSUPP
                   Some bit in the  flags  argument  is  inappropriate  for  the
                   socket type.

        Receives dst.length bytes from the remote but at most as possible with
        one attempt.


        Params:
            dst   = buffer to receive data in
            flags =  the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:

                MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC (recvmsg() only; since Linux 2.6.23)
                       Set  the  close-on-exec  flag  for  the  file  descriptor
                       received via a Unix  domain  file  descriptor  using  the
                       SCM_RIGHTS  operation  (described in unix(7)).  This flag
                       is useful for the same reasons as the O_CLOEXEC  flag  of
                       open(2).

                MSG_DONTWAIT (since Linux 2.2)
                       Enables  nonblocking  operation;  if  the operation would
                       block, the call fails with the error  EAGAIN  or  EWOULD‐
                       BLOCK (this can also be enabled using the O_NONBLOCK flag
                       with the F_SETFL fcntl(2)).
                MSG_OOB
                       This flag requests receipt of out-of-band data that would
                       not be received in the normal data stream.   Some  proto‐
                       cols  place expedited data at the head of the normal data
                       queue, and thus this flag cannot be used with such proto‐
                       cols.

                MSG_PEEK
                       This  flag  causes  the  receive operation to return data
                       from the beginning of the receive queue without  removing
                       that  data  from  the  queue.  Thus, a subsequent receive
                       call will return the same data.

                MSG_TRUNC (since Linux 2.2)
                       For  raw  (AF_PACKET),  Internet  datagram  (since  Linux
                       2.4.27/2.6.8),  and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets:
                       return the real length of the packet  or  datagram,  even
                       when  it  was  longer than the passed buffer.  Not imple‐
                       mented for Unix domain (unix(7)) sockets.

                       For use with Internet stream sockets, see tcp(7).

                MSG_WAITALL (since Linux 2.2)
                       This flag requests that the  operation  block  until  the
                       full  request  is satisfied.  However, the call may still
                       return less data than requested if a signal is caught, an
                       error  or  disconnect  occurs,  or  the  next  data to be
                       received is of a different type than that returned.
                MSG_EOR
                       indicates  end-of-record;  the  data returned completed a
                       record (generally used with  sockets  of  type  SOCK_SEQ‐
                       PACKET).

                MSG_TRUNC
                       indicates  that  the  trailing  portion of a datagram was
                       discarded because the datagram was larger than the buffer
                       supplied.

                MSG_CTRUNC
                       indicates  that  some  control data were discarded due to
                       lack of space in the buffer for ancillary data.

                MSG_OOB
                       is returned to indicate  that  expedited  or  out-of-band
                       data were received.

                MSG_ERRQUEUE
                       indicates that no data was received but an extended error
                       from the socket error queue.

        Returns:
            the number of bytes received on success or -1 on failure.
            On failure errno is set appropriately.

        Errors:

            EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
                   The socket is marked nonblocking and  the  receive  operation
                   would  block, or a receive timeout had been set and the time‐
                   out expired before data was  received.   POSIX.1-2001  allows
                   either  error  to  be  returned  for  this case, and does not
                   require these constants to have the same value, so a portable
                   application should check for both possibilities.

            EBADF  The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.

            ECONNREFUSED
                   A  remote host refused to allow the network connection (typi‐
                   cally because it is not running the requested service).

            EFAULT The receive buffer pointer(s)  point  outside  the  process's
                   address space.

            EINTR  The  receive  was  interrupted by delivery of a signal before
                   any data were available; see signal(7).

            EINVAL Invalid argument passed.

            ENOMEM Could not allocate memory for recvmsg().

            ENOTCONN
                   The socket is associated with a connection-oriented  protocol
                   and has not been connected (see connect(2) and accept(2)).

            ENOTSOCK
                   The argument sockfd does not refer to a socket.
