        Creates an IP socket endpoint for communication and sets this.fd to the
        corresponding file descriptor.

        Params:
            type = desired socket type, which specifies the communication
                semantics.  Supported types are:

                SOCK_STREAM     Provides sequenced, reliable,  two-way,  connec‐
                                tion-based  byte  streams.   An out-of-band data
                                transmission mechanism may be supported.

                SOCK_DGRAM      Supports datagrams - connectionless,  unreliable
                                messages of a fixed maximum length.

                SOCK_SEQPACKET  Provides  a sequenced, reliable, two-way connec‐
                                tion-based data transmission path for  datagrams
                                of  fixed maximum length; a consumer is required
                                to read an entire packet with each input  system
                                call.

                SOCK_RAW        Provides raw network protocol access.

                Some  socket  types may not be implemented by all protocol fami‐
                lies;  for  example,  SOCK_SEQPACKET  is  not  implemented   for
                AF_INET (IPv4).

                Since  Linux  2.6.27, the type argument serves a second purpose:
                in addition to specifying a socket type, it may include the bit‐
                wise  OR  of any of the following values, to modify the behavior
                of socket():

                SOCK_NONBLOCK   Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on  the  new
                                open  file  description.   Using this flag saves
                                extra calls to  fcntl(2)  to  achieve  the  same
                                result.

                SOCK_CLOEXEC    Set  the  close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the
                                new file descriptor.  See the description of the
                                O_CLOEXEC  flag  in open(2) for reasons why this
                                may be useful.

            protocol = desired protocol or 0 to use the default protocol for the
                specified type (e.g. TCP for `type == SOCK_STREAM` or UDP for
                `type == SOCK_DGRAM`).

                The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
                socket.   Normally  only  a  single protocol exists to support a
                particular socket type within a given protocol family, in  which
                case  protocol  can  be specified as 0.  However, it is possible
                that many protocols may exist, in which case a particular proto‐
                col  must  be  specified in this manner.  The protocol number to
                use is specific to the “communication domain” in which  communi‐
                cation  is  to take place; see protocols(5).  See getprotoent(3)
                on how to map protocol name strings to protocol numbers.

                Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams,  simi‐
                lar to pipes.  They do not preserve record boundaries.  A stream
                socket must be in a connected state before any data may be  sent
                or  received  on  it.  A connection to another socket is created
                with a connect(2) call.  Once connected, data may be transferred
                using  read(2) and write(2) calls or some variant of the send(2)
                and recv(2) calls.  When a session has been completed a close(2)
                may  be  performed.  Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as
                described in send(2) and received as described in recv(2).


        Returns:
            the socket file descriptor on success or -1 on failure. On failure
            errno is set appropriately and this.fd is -1.

        Errors:

                   protocol is denied.

                   family.

                   Insufficient memory is available.  The socket cannot be  cre‐
                   ated until sufficient resources are freed.

        Accepts a connection from a listening socket and sets this.fd to the
        accepted socket file descriptor.

        The  accept()  system  call  is  used with connection-based socket types
        (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET).  It extracts the first connection request
        on  the  queue  of pending connections for the listening socket, creates
        a new connected socket, and returns a new file descriptor  referring  to
        that socket.  The newly  created socket  is not in the listening  state.
        The original socket is unaffected by this call.

        If  no  pending  connections are present on the queue, and the socket is
        not marked as nonblocking, accept() blocks the caller until a connection
        is  present.  If the socket is marked nonblocking and no pending connec‐
        tions are present on the queue, accept() fails with the error EAGAIN  or
        EWOULDBLOCK.

        In order to be notified of incoming connections on a socket, you can use
        select(2) or poll(2).  A readable event will be  delivered  when  a  new
        connection  is  attempted and you may then call accept() to get a socket
        for that connection.  Alternatively, you can set the socket  to  deliver
        SIGIO when activity occurs on a socket; see socket(7) for details.

        Params:

                                extra calls to  fcntl(2)  to  achieve  the  same

        that is bound to the address specified by addr.

        Generally,  connection-based protocol sockets may successfully connect()
        only once; connectionless protocol sockets may  use  connect()  multiple
        times  to change their association.  Connectionless sockets may dissolve
        the association by connecting to an address with the sa_family member of
        sockaddr set to AF_UNSPEC (supported on Linux since kernel 2.2).

        Params:
            remote_address = remote address

        Returns:
            0 on success or -1 on failure. On error failure is set
            appropriately.

        Errors:
            The  following  are  general socket errors only.  There may be other
            domain-specific error codes.

            EACCES For Unix domain sockets, which are  identified  by  pathname:
                   Write permission is denied on the socket file, or search per‐
                   mission is denied for one of the directories in the path pre‐
                   fix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

            EACCES, EPERM
                   The user tried to connect to a broadcast address without hav‐
                   ing the socket  broadcast  flag  enabled  or  the  connection
                   request failed because of a local firewall rule.

            EADDRINUSE
                   Local address is already in use.

            EAGAIN No more free local ports or insufficient entries in the rout‐
                   ing    cache.    For   AF_INET   see   the   description   of
                   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range ip(7) for  information
                   on how to increase the number of local ports.

            EALREADY
                   The  socket  is nonblocking and a previous connection attempt
                   has not yet been completed.

            EBADF  The file descriptor is not a valid index  in  the  descriptor
                   table.

            ECONNREFUSED
                   No-one listening on the remote address.

            EFAULT The  socket  structure  address is outside the user's address
                   space.

            EINPROGRESS
                   The socket is nonblocking and the connection cannot  be  com‐
                   pleted  immediately.   It is possible to select(2) or poll(2)
                   for completion by selecting the socket  for  writing.   After
                   select(2)  indicates  writability,  use getsockopt(2) to read
                   the SO_ERROR option at level SOL_SOCKET to determine  whether
                   connect() completed successfully (SO_ERROR is zero) or unsuc‐
                   cessfully (SO_ERROR is one of the usual  error  codes  listed
                   here, explaining the reason for the failure).

            EINTR  The  system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught;
                   see signal(7).

            EISCONN
                   The socket is already connected.

            ENETUNREACH
                   Network is unreachable.

            ENOTSOCK
                   The file descriptor is not associated with a socket.

            ETIMEDOUT
                   Timeout while attempting connection.  The server may  be  too
                   busy to accept new connections.  Note that for IP sockets the
                   timeout may be very long when syncookies are enabled  on  the
                   server.
