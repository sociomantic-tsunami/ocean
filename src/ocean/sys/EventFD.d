/*******************************************************************************

    Linux custom file descriptor event.

    eventfd man page follows:

    Creates an "eventfd object" that can be used as an event wait/notify
    mechanism by userspace applications, and by the kernel to notify userspace
    applications of events. The object contains an unsigned 64-bit integer
    (ulong) counter that is maintained  by the kernel.

    The following operations can be performed on the file descriptor:

    read(2)
        If the eventfd counter has a nonzero value, then a read(2) returns 8
        bytes containing that value, and the counter's value is reset to zero.
        (The returned value is in host byte order, i.e., the native byte order
        for integers on the host machine.)
        If the counter is zero at the time of the read(2), then the call either
        blocks until the counter becomes nonzero, or fails with the error EAGAIN
        if the file descriptor has been made non-blocking (via the use of the
        fcntl(2) F_SETFL operation to set the O_NONBLOCK flag).

        A read(2) will fail with the error EINVAL if the size of the supplied
        buffer is less than 8 bytes.

    write(2)
        A write(2) call adds the 8-byte integer value supplied in its buffer to
        the counter. The maximum value that may be stored in the counter is the
        largest unsigned 64-bit value minus 1 (i.e., 0xfffffffffffffffe). If
        the addition would cause the counter's value to exceed the maximum,
        then the write(2) either blocks until a read(2) is performed on the file
        descriptor, or fails with the error EAGAIN if the file descriptor has
        been made non-blocking.
        A write(2) will fail with the error EINVAL if the size of the supplied
        buffer is less than 8 bytes, or if an attempt is made to write the value
        0xffffffffffffffff.

    poll(2), select(2) (and similar)
        The returned file descriptor supports poll(2) (and analogously epoll(7))
        and select(2), as follows:

        The file descriptor is readable (the select(2) readfds argument; the
        poll(2) POLLIN flag) if the counter has a value greater than 0.

        The file descriptor is writable (the select(2) writefds argument; the
        poll(2) POLLOUT flag) if it is possible to write a value of at least
        "1" without blocking.

        The file descriptor indicates an exceptional condition (the select(2)
        exceptfds argument; the poll(2) POLLERR flag) if an overflow of the
        counter value was detected. As noted above, write(2) can never overflow
        the counter. However an overflow can occur if 2^64 eventfd "signal
        posts" were performed by the KAIO subsystem (theoretically possible,
        but practically unlikely). If an overflow has occurred, then read(2)
        will return that maximum uint64_t value (i.e., 0xffffffffffffffff). The
        eventfd file descriptor also supports the other file-descriptor
        multiplexing APIs: pselect(2), ppoll(2), and epoll(7).

    close(2)
        When the file descriptor is no longer required it should be closed.
        When all file descriptors associated with the same eventfd object have
        been closed, the resources for object are freed by the kernel.

    A copy of the file descriptor created by eventfd() is inherited by the child
    produced by fork(2). The duplicate file descriptor is associated with the
    same eventfd object. File descriptors created by eventfd() are preserved
    across execve(2).
