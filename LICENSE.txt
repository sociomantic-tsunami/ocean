This project includes parts of the Tango[1] project, and because of that the
license terms are not trivial.

All files written by dunnhumby Germany GmbH that are free from Tango code are
distributed under a dual license: Boost Software License Version 1.0 and Tango
3-Clause BSD License (you can pick one and only follow the terms of that one).

Almost all files coming from the Tango project have another dual license: Tango
3-Clause BSD and Academic Free License v3.0. A few files have MIT license
though, but this license is more permissive than Tango 3-Clause BSD, so you
should still be able to use all the code under the terms of the Tango 3-Clause
BSD license.

So, for all practical purposes you can consider this project to be distributed
under Tango 3-Clause BSD License. If you need to use any of the other license
options, please consult each file's headers to know the exact licensing options
if you need to use a license other than Tango 3-Clause BSD.

Also please note that some parts of ocean depend on external library
functionality whose license may be more restrictive than those described here;
this may affect the licenses you can choose between when distributing aggregate
binary works.  If you link against any external libraries when building your
ocean-derived project, you should check all the individual licenses for those
libraries to see if more restrictive terms apply.

For the complete license text, please consult the files LICENSE_BSD.txt and
LICENSE_BOOST.txt for Sociomantic files and LICENSE_TANGO.txt for Tango files.
