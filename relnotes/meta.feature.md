* `ocean.meta.types.Qualifiers`

  Moved `istring`/`cstring`/`mstring` definitions from `ocean.transition`
  module, keeping them available in original module via non-deprecated alias.
  This is done as part of splitting `ocean.transition` into smaller parts and
  thus simplifying dependency chains.
