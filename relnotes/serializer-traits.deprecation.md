* `ocean.util.serializer.model.Traits`

  The traits that check serializer/deserializer interface via structural typing
  have been deprecated and current serializer/decorator implementation adapted
  to not use them.

  Those originated in over-generalized assumption that new framework will
  be use to adjust all over serializers but it proved to be impactical for
  the time. This has proven to not be the case and only complicated development.
