* `ocean.util.app.ext.VersionArgsExt`

  The `getLibsVersionsString()` method learned a new optional argument `pop`
  that will pop any library version found while generating the string.

  Also the version string now will include unknown items present in the
  `version_info`. See the migration notes for details on the format.
