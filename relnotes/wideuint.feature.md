* `ocean.math.WideUInt`

  New module that implements non-negative integer number of a fixed size. It is
  intended as `BigInt` replacement that works as pure value type and thus fits
  Sociomantic memory usage patterns.

  Initial implementation provides bare minimum of functionality. More API
  boilerplate (like various operator overloads) will be added later on demand.
