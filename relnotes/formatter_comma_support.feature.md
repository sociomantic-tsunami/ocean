* `ocean.text.convert.Formatter`

  Use `{_}` format specifier to print a comma `,` after every 3rd digit when
  printing a decimal integers or a floating point number.  If combined with a
  hex-number specifier `{:x_}` or with a binary number specifier  `{:b_}`, then
  the `_` character is used and will be placed after every 4th digit instead.
