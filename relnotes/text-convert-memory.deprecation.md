* `ocean.text.convert.Memory`

  This module, and its sole function, `memoryToHexAscii`, is unused among all Sociomantic project.
  Similar result can be achieved through `sformat(output, "{X}", memory_slice)`, for short slices of memory.
  If this function is really needed, contact ocean's maintainer or copy it in your project.
