* `ocean.text.convert.Integer`

  A new method `floatStringToInteger` is available which parses floating point
  strings into integer values while keeping the desired precision.
  The number is represented as a multiplied integer in that case.

  This can be very useful if you receive float-string values but want to avoid
  dealing with floating point arithmetic in your program.

  Check the documentation for more information.
