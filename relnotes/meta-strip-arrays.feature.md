* `ocean.meta.types.Arrays`

  `ocean.core.Traits.BaseTypeOfArrays` was reimplemented as
  new `StripAllArrays` utility. It strips all top-most arrays
  from a type recursively. Same as with other `ocean.meta` utilities, it is
  intended to replace original version in `ocean.core.Traits` in the very
  long term.
