## Contiguous (de)serializer does not support recursive types

This struct used to be accepted by serializer but will cause compilation error
with the new ocean:

```D
struct S
{
  S[] x;
}
```

This is unfortunate side effect of making serializer more generic and
separating type analysis from serialization code. As this feature was not used
by Sociomantic projects and new implementation will simplify maintenance, it was
considered a desirable trade-off.
