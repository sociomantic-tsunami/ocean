## All remaining utilities utilities (Stdout, AppStatus, stream...) were switched to Formatter

* `ocean.io.Stdout`, `ocean.io.console.AppStatus`, `ocean.io.stream.Format`,
  `ocean.text.Arguments`, `ocean.util.log.Stats`

All remaining users of `ocean.text.convert.Layout[_tango]` have been switched to the Formatter.
For those which see their API affected, the most common use case of passing arguments will work just as before.
Overriding the formatting function will not be possible anymore (as they are template), but redefinition is.

However, forwarding variadic arguments won't work, so functions wishing to forward arguments must be defined as templated functions, as shown in `PeriodicTrace` release notes.

Little difference in output is expected. Pointers will be formatted as fixed-length hexadecimal,
associative arrays will be formatted as `[ Key: value...]` instead of `{ Key: value... }`,
qualified (`const` / `immutable`) arguments will be correctly formatted, as well as structs,
making the output consistent accross ocean (as the Logger module already uses the Formatter).
