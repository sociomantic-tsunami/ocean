## All remaining utilities (Stdout, AppStatus, stream...) were switched to Formatter

* `ocean.io.Stdout`, `ocean.io.console.AppStatus`, `ocean.io.stream.Format`,
  `ocean.text.Arguments`, `ocean.util.log.Stats`

  All remaining users of `ocean.text.convert.Layout[_tango]` have been switched to
  the Formatter.  For those which see their API affected, the most common use case
  of passing arguments will work just as before.  Overriding the formatting
  function will not be possible anymore (as they are template), but redefinition
  is.

  However, forwarding variadic arguments won't work, so functions wishing to
  forward arguments must be defined as templated functions, as shown in
  `PeriodicTrace` release notes.

  Little difference in output is expected. Pointers will be formatted as
  fixed-length hexadecimal, associative arrays will be formatted as `[ Key:
  value...]` instead of `{ Key: value... }`, qualified (`const` / `immutable`)
  arguments will be correctly formatted, as well as structs, making the output
  consistent accross ocean (as the Logger module already uses the Formatter).

* `ocean.util.log.Stats`

  Protected `layout` field was replaced with protected `buffer` field which serves
  the same purpose but is a simple `AppendBuffer` now. Derivative classes have to
  adjust their code to use `this.buffer`.
