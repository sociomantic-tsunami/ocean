# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

We'd love to accept your issues and (especially) patches! If you have found a
bug you can submit an issue describing it and one of the repo maintainers will
get back to you. Alternately you can submit a PR and the sections below outline
the process.

## Contributing a Patch

1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
1. Break your changes in to a series of logical self-contained commits.
1. Include release notes files when appropriate following the guidelines
   in [Neptune](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/neptune/blob/master/doc/library-contributor.rst).
1. Submit your pull request.

## Reviewing and Rebasing and Merging Patches

1. All feedback should be professionally given and non-personal. Offensive,
   intimidating, insulting, racist, homophobic, and sexist comments and
   behavior will not be tolerated.
1. Reviewers will comment on your code providing feedback to point out any
   problems and improve the quality of the code. Feel free to respond to these
   comments if you have any questions to clarify the meaning of the comments.
1. Please try and pay attention to all the comments and address them as it is
   frustrating for reviewers to review a PR multiple times and find the same
   issues.
1. Reviewers can mark a PR as "changes requested" or "approved".
1. Once a PR has been approved by at least one reviewer and they are no
   outstanding comments that have not been addressed from other reviewers,
   either a reviewer or the submitter can rebase and merge the PR.
1. Repo owners try to review PRs promptly, you can feel free to give a "Ping!"
   if there has been no response for a few days.
